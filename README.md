# Retail Sales Analysis and Forecasting with Time Series Modeling

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data and forecasting future sales and volatility using time series modeling techniques. The goal is to provide actionable insights for inventory management, promotional activities, and stock allocation during high-demand periods such as holidays.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Correlation analysis of key features.
   - Visualizations of sales trends and seasonality.

2. **Time Series Decomposition:**
   - Trend, seasonality, and residual analysis.

3. **Forecasting Using Exponential Smoothing:**
   - Holt-Winters method for accurate sales prediction.

4. **Volatility Testing and Modeling:**
   - ARCH/GARCH models to analyze and forecast sales volatility.

5. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Strategies for optimizing inventory and promotions.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `statsmodels`, `arch`: Time series decomposition and volatility modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `ExponentialSmoothing` for forecasting.
  - `ARCH/GARCH` models for volatility analysis.

---

## 📊 Data Description
The dataset contains weekly sales data of a retail chain along with other features like:
- **Store**: Store ID.
- **Date**: Week ending date.
- **WeeklySales**: Weekly sales amount.
- **Holidays**: Indicator for holiday weeks.
- **Month, Year, WeekOfYear**: Derived date features.

## 📈 Results
### **1. Correlation Analysis**
- Heatmap reveals strong correlations between features like `Store`, `Date`, and `WeeklySales`.

### **2. Time Series Decomposition**
- **Trend**: Increasing sales over time, especially during specific seasons.
- **Seasonality**: Clear weekly and annual patterns due to promotions and holidays.
- **Residual**: Random noise captured in the residual component.

### **3. Forecasting Results**
- Using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, sales are accurately predicted for future weeks with high reliability.

### **4. Volatility Analysis**
- GARCH(1,1) model effectively captures sales volatility.
- Conditional volatility forecasts show high-risk weeks for demand spikes.

## 📋 Actionable Insights
1. **Inventory Optimization**:
   - Increase stock levels for high-demand weeks predicted by the model.
   - Reduce overstocking during low-demand periods.

2. **Promotional Activities**:
   - Enhance marketing efforts during volatile weeks to boost sales.
   - Plan discounts around holiday seasons to capitalize on high demand.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Use conditional volatility forecasts to prepare for sudden sales spikes.
